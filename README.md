# Bread Express

This project was created as the final phase of 67-272: Application Design and Development. This project was created to satisfy the following requirements, which are taken from the assignment brief.

> *What is Bread Express?*

> The idea behind Bread Express is that customers will be able to go online and order from a selection of breads, muffins and pastries. Each evening at 9pm the bakers will come in, review a list of items that need to be created and bake all the items that were ordered the previous day. By 12am the shippers will review the orders that need to be filled, pack each order into boxes and have them express shipped so that customers will have their orders in hand no later than 4:30pm that day. 
> To do that Alex and Mark need an online application where customers can visit, create an account, view various items, order those items and manage their personal information. The system needs to also generate a list of items (and quantities) that needed to be baked at the end of each day. Lastly the system must be able to list the orders that need to be shipped, including an itemized list of breads, muffins and pastries that go into each order and the address that order has to be shipped to.
